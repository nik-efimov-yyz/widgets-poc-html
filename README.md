# Widgets POC - Basic HTML Page

Open `index.html`

Would-be npm packages are found in /packages

Key concepts:

- SDK script is imported. It acts as the business logic. Widgets themselves are mostly presentational
- Individual widget scripts are imported as needed
- SDK is initialized by the client script
- Widget CSS variables may be overriden on the page
